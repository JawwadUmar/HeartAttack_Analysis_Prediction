# Heart Attack Overview
A heart attack, scientifically known as myocardial necrosis, occurs due to acute and sustained ischemia and hypoxia in the coronary artery, leading to manifestations like arrhythmia, shock, or heart failure, which can prove fatal. This life-threatening event transpires when blood flow to the heart is obstructed, typically caused by the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other substances, forming arterial plaques in the coronary arteries. In some cases, these plaques can rupture, forming clots that further impede blood circulation.

# Dataset Details:
The dataset comprises 303 rows and 14 columns, including the "Output" label. It encompasses both categorical and numerical data.

# Data Cleaning:
Only one duplicate row exists in the dataset, which can be easily removed for cleaner data.

# Data Visualization:
The data visualization process unfolds step by step, involving critical analysis. Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are employed to create informative barplots, distribution plots, and line plots that illustrate feature comparisons and correlations.

# Methodology:
To address the medical objectives and diagnose heart disease, various data science techniques have been employed. These techniques interpret medical goals and utilize a suitable machine learning algorithm, namely Logistic Regression, for training and implementation in Python to develop a predictive model. This model, when applied to the dataset, aids medical experts in predicting and diagnosing heart attacks. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to extract valuable insights from the data.

# Results:
The dataset was trained and tested using the Logistic Regression algorithm, resulting in an accuracy rate of 81.5%.
